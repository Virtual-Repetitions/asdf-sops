# FAQ

## Why vreps-sops instead of sops?

We call it vreps-sops to avoid a naming conflict with [this sops plugin](https://github.com/feniix/asdf-sops). This was created without realizing that plugin existed. However, I think maintaining our own asdf plugin allows for greater security around a core piece of our codebase.
